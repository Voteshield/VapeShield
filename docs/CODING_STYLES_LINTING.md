# Coding style and linting

Having consistent coding style ensures easier readability and collaboration, and linting also helps catch bugs early.

## EditorConfig

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is a low-level code style tool that affects things like spacing and line endings. EditorConfig is most helpful when you install the [relevant plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed) for the IDE that you are using.
